# NGEE-T ED-CLM git repository
------------------------------

Repository for de-CLM-ification of ED. Contains a full copy of CLM
from recent svn trunk tags. Once ED has been isolated into a
standalone library, it will be moved into a new stand alone git repo
without a copy of CLM.

## Repository structure
-----------------------

Branches
  * master : ED-CLM trunk
  * clm-trunk : clm trunk tags from CESM svn
  * cesm2git : tools for pulling svn branch tags into git
