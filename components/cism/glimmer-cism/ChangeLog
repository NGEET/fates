Changes in CISM Version 2.0
===========================

CISM version 2.0, which originated from Glimmer-CISM and Glimmer, has a number of major changes and additions relative to these previous codes, including:

* addition of robust, parallel, 2D and 3D, higher-order accurate approximations to the Stokes momentum balance (Blatter-Pattyn, L1L2, and SSA, all available within the "Glissade" dynamical core)
* adition of 3D, parallel mass and temperature transport
* addition of software interfaces to modern C++ based solver libraries (e.g., Trilinos)
* replacement of the Autotools build system with Cmake build system
* addition of new test cases for higher-order models, including several with analytical solutions
* re-ordering of the time step to be fully consistent with explicit forward Euler scheme
* addition of a new high level "cism_driver", which replaces and reproduces functionality of several old drivers and allows for more flexible integration of additional and/or external dycores
* re-arrangement of the directory structure
* modifications to the Glint coupling software to support coupling with CESM and other climate models that compute surface mass balance external to the ice sheet model
* new and updated documentation
