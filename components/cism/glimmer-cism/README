CISM README file:
===================

CISM is a land ice model designed to be used as part of an earth-system model 
or as a stand-alone model. Full documentation can be found at:
http://oceans11.lanl.gov/cism/documentation.html

Licensing:
=========

CISM is issued under the Lesser GNU General Public Licence (see LICENSE in the main directory).

Note that this licence DOES NOT APPLY to the SLAP linear algebra library, used by the serial
code, which is included here in its own directory (./libglimmer-solve/SLAP), and is in the public 
domain.


Mailing list:
=============

There are two mailing lists, once for general users and one for developers:

1. The general user mailing list can be signed up for by sending an email to:
   cism-users+subscribe@googlegroups.com

1. The developers mailing list can be signed up for by sending an email to:
   cism-devel+subscribe@googlegroups.com

Note that because these lists are managed by GoogleGroups, they will *always* attempt to associate
you with a Google email address. To insure that the email you would like to use is associated with the
list, please make sure you entirely log out of any Google services before attempting to sign up for the
mailing list. The sign-up process will require you to authenticate the email address you wish to use by
taking you to a website where you will be prompted to enter that information.  


Discussion Board:
=================

A discussion board for getting help with running CISM, either in stand-alone mode or as part of CESM, can
be found at: http://bb.cgd.ucar.edu/forums/ice-sheet-modeling-cism

(under "Issues"): https://github.com/cism/cism/issues
