CISM Version 2.0
================

CISM2.0, which originated from Glimmer-CISM and Glimmer, has a number of major changes
relative to these previous codes:

* addition of robust, parallel, 3D, 1st-order accurate approximation to the Stokes momentum 
    balance ("Glissade" dynamical core)
* adition of 3D, parallel mass and temperature transport
* addition of software interfaces to modern C++ based solver libraries (e.g., Trilinos)
* replacement of the Autotools build system with Cmake build system
* addition of new test cases for higher-order models
* re-ordering of the time step to be fully consistent with explicit forward Euler scheme
* addition of a new high level "cism_driver", which replaces and reproduces functionality of several 
    old drivers and allows for more flexible integration of additional and/or external dycores
* re-arrangement of the directory structure 
* modifications to the GLINT coupling software to support coupling with CESM and other climate models 
    that compute surface mass balance external to the ice sheet model
* new and updated documentation
