This directory holds example do-configure scripts for building Trilinos for use with CISM.
Refer to comments in the scripts and the CISM Documentation for details.
Note that these scripts should NOT be run in the location, but moved to your Trilinos
build location after downloading Trilinos source code from http://trilinos.sandia.gov/.
They are provided as examples with the required Trilinos packages and settings enabled.
