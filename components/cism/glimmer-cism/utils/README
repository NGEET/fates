The various subdirectories in this directory hold utilities that may be useful for working with CISM.  
The 'build' subdirectory holds scripts that are used by the cmake build system when building the code 
and is necessary for successful compiling.  The other subdirectories hold miscellaneous tools that are 
not required, but may be useful.  See the individual README files in each subdirectory for details.
