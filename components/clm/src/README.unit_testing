# To run all CIME unit tests on caldera, run the following command:
# (Note that this must be done from an interactive caldera session, not from yellowstone)
# (One way to do that is to prepend with the "execca" utility that sends the resulting command to caldera)
execca ../../../cime/tools/unit_testing/run_tests.py --test-spec-dir=. --compiler=intel --mpilib=mpich2 \
--mpirun-command=mpirun.lsf --cmake-args=-DPAPI_LIB=/glade/apps/opt/papi/5.3.0/intel/12.1.5/lib64 &

# The inclusion of PAPI_LIB is needed above since config_compilers includes:
#   <ADD_SLIBS> -Wl,-rpath ${PAPI_LIB} -L${PAPI_LIB} -lpapi</ADD_SLIBS>
# On a different machine besides yellowstone the path would obviously be different

# NOTE: If the above fails with something like...
