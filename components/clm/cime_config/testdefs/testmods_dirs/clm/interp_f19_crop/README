This testmods directory allows testing the interpolation of initial conditions
from one resolution (or configuration) to another, using the out-of-the-box
initial conditions file for f19 with crop.

Note: if we stop supporting out-of-the-box f19 initial conditions files, this
could be changed to f09 (or whatever resolution we provide initial conditions
for).

Note: If this test fails, it may be because you need to update the
initial conditions file it uses (finidat). finidat should be updated
to match the out-of-the-box initial conditions file for f19 with crop.
