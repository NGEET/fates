This testmods directory allows testing glc_mec cases using (partially) spun-up
initial conditions. Once we have out-of-the-box initial conditions with glc_mec,
this will no longer be necessary.

Note that this uses an initial conditions file for f19_g16, year 1850.

This also turns off the glc two-way coupling. This is done so that
glacier areas are taken from the restart file rather than from
CISM. This is partly so that changes in CISM don't affect the test
results, but more importantly so that LII tests can pass even if CISM
changes. (GLC two-way coupling was off in the generation of the
initial conditions file used here, too.)
