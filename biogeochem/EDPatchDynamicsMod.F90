  ! from the disturbance, we need to send some amount from the old patch to
  ! the new patch.  If the plant matter falls straight down, then that
  ! would make a case for all of the litter going to the new patch. 
  ! This would be localization=1
  ! But if we think some of the plant matter drifts, or a tall tree lands
  ! outside of its gap, or are afraid of newly formed patches having 
  ! too much burnable material, then we drop the localization from 1 down
  ! a notch.
  ! Note that in all cases, a localization of 0, suggests that litter
  ! is dispensed randomly in space among the area of the new and old
  ! patch combined. A localization of 1 suggests that
  ! all litter is sent to the new patch.

    !
    ! Also, note we are not transfering in diagnostics that were calculated

    ! it can burn.
