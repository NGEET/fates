thread for "Introduction to Subversion"...(070208)

Working with externals:

checkout the HEAD of clm's trunk into working copy directory
> svn co $SVN/clm2/trunk clm_trunk_head_wc

view the property set for clm's external definitions
> svn propget svn:externals clm_trunk_head_wc

view revision, URL and other useful information specific to external files
> cd clm_trunk_head_wc/components/clm/src
> svn info main

create new clm branch for mods required of clm
> svn copy $SVN/clm2/trunk_tags/<tag-to-branch-from> $SVN/clm2/branches/<new-branch-name> -m "appropriate message"

have external directories in working copy refer to new clm branch to make changes
> svn switch $SVN/clm2/branches/<new-branch-name>/src/main main

--make changes to clm files--

when satisfied with changes and testing, commit to HEAD of clm branch
> svn commit main -m "appropriate message"

tag new version of clm branch - review naming conventions!
> svn copy $SVN/clm2/branches/<new-branch-name> $SVN/clm2/branch_tags/<new-branch-name>_tags/<new-tag-name> -m "appropriate message"

have external directories in working copy refer to new clm tag
> svn switch $SVN/clm2/branch_tags/<new-branch-name>_tags/<new-tag-name>/src/main main

modify clm's property for external definitions in working copy
> vi clm_trunk_head_wc/SVN_EXTERNAL_DIRECTORIES

--point definition to URL of new-tag-name--

set the property - don't forget the 'dot' at the end!
> svn propset svn:externals -F SVN_EXTERNAL_DIRECTORIES clm_trunk_head_wc

--continue with other clm mods--

commit changes from working copy directory to HEAD of clm trunk - NOTE: a commit from here will *NOT* recurse to external directories
> cd clm_trunk_head_wc
> svn commit -m "appropriate message"

tag new version of clm trunk
> svn copy $SVN/clm2/trunk $SVN/clm2/trunk_tags/<new-tag-name> -m "appropriate message"
