For the trunk:

1.) Start at the top level directory of your sandbox

  cd $clm_root

2.) Update JUST the top level directory with the externals.

  svn update --depth immediates

3.) Move any local changes you have under clm
    (This preserves any local changes you have in your sandbox, as well as changes on your branch)

  svn mv models/lnd/clm/ components/clm

4.) Move any local changes you have under scripts to save your cases
    (if you don't have cases to save under scripts, you don't have
     to do this step)

  svn mkdir --parents cime/scripts
  mv scripts cime/scripts/

5.) Bring in updated externals and updates to clm source files

  svn update

6.) Mark changes to models directory as resolved

  svn resolved models


For branches:

0.) Make sure ALL your changes are checked into your branch.

1.) Checkout your branch WITHOUT externals

  svn co --ignore-externals $SVN_MOD_URL/clm2/branches/<branchname>

2.) Move any changes you have under clm on your branch

  svn mkdir components
  svn mv models/lnd/clm/ components/clm

3.) Merge the top level

  svn merge --depth immediates $SVN_MOD_URL/clm2/trunk_tags/clm4_5_1_r104 $SVN_MOD_URL/clm2/trunk_tags/clm4_5_1_r105

4.) Merge changes in the clm directory

  svn merge $SVN_MOD_URL/clm2/trunk_tags/clm4_5_1_r104/models/lnd/clm $SVN_MOD_URL/clm2/trunk_tags/clm4_5_1_r105/components/clm

5.) Bring in updated externals and updates to clm source files

  svn update

6.) Mark changes to models and components/clm directories as resolved

  svn resolved models
  svn resolved components
  svn resolved components/clm
