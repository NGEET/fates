<hr noshade="noshade" size="2" width="100%" align="LEFT">
<h3>gptl-v5.3.2</h3>
<ul>
<li> Bugfix to enable multiplexed use of latest PAPI library which includes
  the <em>Component</em> interface (PAPI-C), which became available around
  PAPI-3.9.0. The problem occurred in GPTL because the PAPI-C API changed
  slightly vs. previous versions. Thanks to Crystal Jernigan of ORNL for
  discovering and reporting the bug. 
</li><li> New entry point <b>GPTLprint_rusage()</b> enables printing useful
    information from standard C library routine <b>getrusage()</b>. This is
    the preferred mechanism for getting memory hiwater mark from GPTL now that Linux
    supports it (as of Linux 2.6.32). Other information printed includes
    number of hard and soft page faults, and number of voluntary context switches.
</li><li> Do not print values of timers which are ON. This is 
    because a GPTLstop call is required to achieve a current accumulation.
</li><li> Obsoleted FORTRANCAPS
</li><li> Relevant to ENABLE_PMPI=yes only: Migrate specification of
    MPI_STATUS_SIZE up to macros.make. A value of 10 is now more common,
    while in older MPI libraries it was often 5.
</li><li> Relevant to ENABLE_PMPI=yes only: Bugfix to PMPI hooks enables use
    of recent MPI libraries which include mods to the function prototypes
    adding "const" to appropriate MPI arguments. This was a change to the MPI
    standard adopted around definition of the MPI 2.2 standard.
<p> 
  <b>Note to MPI forum:</b> Please only change existing API specs when absolutely
  necessary! Changing the API can cause major disruption to other library
  developers and to users of your library! The recent addition of "const" to
  the API spec of some arguments of existing MPI functions seems totally
  unnecessary.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>gptl-v5.0</h3>
<ul>
<li> Lower overhead incurred by the GPTL library itself: New hash algorithm results in fewer 
  collisions by employing better randomization.
<li> Improved user interface to <b>GPTLstart_handle()</b> and <b>GPTLstop_handle()</b> by changing
  the second argument (the <em>handle</em>) to be the hash index instead of a
  pointer to the timer itself. This has the <em>huge</em> advantage that inside of
  threaded loops, thread-local storage for the <em>handle</em> variable is no longer
  required in user code. The previous severe restriction of thread-local storage for these
  variables effectively rendered <b>GPTLstart_handle()</b> and <b>GPTLstop_handle()</b>
  unusable inside of threaded regions. And threaded regions are exactly where these more
  efficient equivalents of <b>GPTLstart()</b> and <b>GPTLstop()</b> are most likely to be
  useful! 

  <p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> Slight API changes to <b>GPTLstart_handle()</b>
  and <b>GPTLstop_handle()</b> were required. In C/C++ the type of the <em>handle</em>
  argument was changed from <em>void **</em> to <em>int *</em>. In Fortran the type
  changed from <em>integer(8)</em> to <em>integer</em>. Tests of the new library with the
  GNU compilers using the old types produced compiler warnings but still worked
  properly.
<li> Produce a much more accurate estimate of the overhead incurred by the GPTL
  library itself. Previously, the overhead estimate printed was only for the underlying
  timing utility employed by GPTL (e.g. gettimeofday()). Now the printed overhead estimate
  is for the <em>entire</em> GPTL library, not just the underlying timing utility.

  <p>Also, a breakdown of overhead components by GPTL function is presented
  when <b>gptlpr()</b> or <b>gptlpr_file()</b> are called. Examples include the Fortran
  wrapper layer, generating the hash index, and calling the underlying timing
  routine. More importantly, also printed is a per-region estimate of total overhead
  incurred, and total overhead incurred in the parent of the region as a 
  result of timing the region.

  <p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>: Currently GPTL doesn't know if the user API was Fortran or
  C/C++. Also, calls to the start/stop routines can be intermixed with their
  start_handle and stop_handle counterparts at will. Therefore GPTL produces a
  "worst-case" estimate of induced overhead. Specifically, Fortran user-level code and
  exclusive use of <b>GPTLstart()/GPTLstop()</b> instead of the more efficient
  <b>GPTLstart_handle()</b> and <b>GPTLstop_handle()</b> is assumed. Users can refine the
  overhead estimate by hand by subtracting the components which do not apply. For example,
  if the Fortran API is not used and GPTL reports that the relative cost of the Fortran
  API is 10% of the total overhead, the total overhead estimate can be reduced by 10%.
</ul>

<h3>gptl-v4.3</h3>
<ul>
<li> Complete rewrite of <b>GPTLpr_summary()</b> for accuracy and scalability to many thousands 
  of cores. Mean and standard deviation timing statistics across MPI tasks are calculated using 
  the algorithm of Chan et. al. described
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance">here</a>.
  It is a one-pass algorithm well-suited to parallel computation. Additional statistics
  from <b>GPTLpr_summary()</b> include max and min times across MPI tasks, MPI rank responsible
  for max and min times, threading information, and PAPI statistics (if applicable). Thanks to
  Pat Worley for suggesting the addition of this scalable function to GPTL.
</li><li> Added option <b>GPTLmaxthreads</b> to the list of settable options in
      <b>GPTLsetoption()</b>. This setting indicates the maximum number of threads (OMP 
      or pthreads) that can have timers enabled. Especially useful when building
      with <b>THREADED_PTHREADS</b> because the internal thread array used in this mode 
      defaults to a fixed size. If this size is much larger than needed it
      will result in large memory wastage. If too small it limits the number of threads which
      can enable timers. Also useful when GPTL is built with <b>OPENMP=yes</b>, in cases where the 
      invoking application sets the number of threads <em>after</em> <b>GPTLinitialize()</b> 
      is called.
</li><li> Changed default value of MAX_THREADS from 256 to 64. This value is only relevant 
      when GPTL is built with <b>PTHREADS=yes</b>).
</li><li> Bugfix for Fortran namelist parsing which indicated the incorrect print method to
      be applied in <b>GPTLpr()</b>.
</li><li> Bugfix for incorrect estimate of memory overhead caused by the timing library itself.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>gptl-v4.2</h3>
<li> Enable <b>GPTLget_wallclock()</b> and <b>GPTLget_eventvalue()</b> to work when passed either
  auto-instrumented or manually instrumented regions.
</li><li> Modify print_memusage to ensure size2 always exceeds size
</li><li> Add tests of <b>GPTLget_nregions()</b>, <b>GPTLget_regionname()</b>, and <b>GPTLget_wallclock()</b> to 
  cygprofile
</li><li> Add MPI_Ssend test to pmpi.c, and checks that MPI wrappers are working for
      all expected regions.

<h3>gptl-v4.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Speedups for PTHREADS implementation eliminate
  critical sections except on 1st invocation of each timer. Library overhead
  is significantly reduced on many machines, especially when applications
  are profiled with high thread counts.
</li><li>New entries <b>GPTLstart_handle()</b> and <b>GPTLstop_handle()</b>. These
  routines work just like <b>GPTLstart()</b> and <b>GPTLstop()</b>, except
  they take a 2nd argument, a "handle" to the region being
  timed. The space for this argument is provided by the user, but is managed
  by GPTL. It contains the address of the region being timed, and allows GPTL
  to bypass determing the hash value and performing an address lookup on each
  call. See "man GPTLstart_handle", and <a href="http://jmrosinski.github.com/GPTL/example7.html">Example 7</a>.
</li><li>New underlying timer option for AIX "read_real_time", provides
  significantly better granularity than gettimeofday, with somewhat lower
  overhead.
</li><li>Now safe to call <b>GPTLinitialize()</b> after <b>GPTLfinalize()</b>.
</li><li>Works with craycc/crayftn (see macros.make.xt5).
</li></ul>

<h3>gptl-v3.7</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added Fortran module enabling "use gptl" instead of "include gptl.inc". 
Adds interface block for argument checking.
</li><li>Enable auto-profiling under AIX.
</li><li>Enable <b>GPTLprint_memusage()</b> under MacOS (thanks to Chuck Bardeen).
</li><li>Bugfix for Fortran entry <b>gptlget_regionname()</b> to remove null terminator put 
there by underlying <b>GPTLget_regionname()</b>.
</li><li>Bugfix for "make install" creates directories if they don't already exist.
</li><li>Added auto-profiling entry for MPI_Init_thread.
</li><li>Changed default print method from most_frequent to full_tree.
</li></ul>

<h3>gptl-v3.6.3</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>GPTLprint_memusage()</b> converts memory usage units to MB by default (if possible).
</li><li>Added support for bluegene (see macros.make.bluegene).
</li><li>Bugfix for gptl_papilibraryinit (Fortran): needed to return an int.
</li><li>Bugfix for GPTLpr_summary: slave tried to receive too much data.
</li><li>Changed LINUX ifdef to HAVE_SLASHPROC. Not all Linux systems have /proc/pid/statm.
</li><li>Makefile uses "findstring xlf" to decide how Fortran defines are set.
</li></ul>

<h3>gptl-v3.6.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bugfix for auto-profiling MPI_Recv wrapper (when ENABLE_PMPI is set in macros.make): 
 previous version could cause hangs in some cases.
</li><li>Added auto-profiling entries for more MPI routines: MPI_Iprobe, MPI_Probe, MPI_Ssend, 
 MPI_Alltoallv, MPI_Scatterv, MPI_Test.
</li><li>Better estimates of bytes transferred for auto-profiled MPI routines.
</li></ul>

<h3>gptl-v3.6</h3>
<ul>
<li>Makefile simplification. Can now run "make" from ctests/ and ftests/.
</li><li>Initial set of PMPI wrappers. Automatically generates MPI times and
  statistics for the most common MPI calls.
</li><li>Option to synchronize and time certain collectives (see ENABLE_PMPI in
  macros.make.linux). Note that the set of MPI routines profiled is not yet
  complete. This option has not yet been fully tested.
</li></ul>

<h3>gptl-v3.5.2</h3>
<ul>
<li> Bugfix for when omp_get_max_threads() returns zero.
</li><li> <b>GPTLallocate()</b> returns error when asked for zero bytes.
</li></ul>

<h3>gptl-v3.5.1</h3>
<ul>
<li> OpenMP applications now work when GPTL is built with PTHREADS
</li><li> Fortran bugfix enables longer event names. This allows one to enable the
  PAPI native event names which can be long.
</li><li> Remove some of the relatively unuseful entries from ctests/ and ftests/.
</li><li> Tested on AIX.
</li></ul>

<h3>gptl-v3.5</h3>
<ul>
<li> Easier linking with C++ applications.
</li><li> Options for call-tree generation based on number of invocations per
parent: most_frequent (default), first_parent, last_parent, full_tree. 
Previous versions always used first_parent. New option <em>full_tree</em> can
produce <b>tons</b> of output depending the nature of the call tree. But it
can also be very useful because it shows all parent-child relationships.
</li><li> Derived events based on PAPI:
  <ul>
  <li> L2 miss rate (GPTL_L2MRT)
  </li><li> Load-stores per L2 miss (GPTL_LSTPL2M)
  </li><li> L3 miss rate (GPTL_L3MRT)
  </li></ul>
</li><li> Function <b>GPTLpr_summary()</b> now takes an MPI communicator as its
argument. Passing an "int" doesn't work with some MPI implementations (e.g. OpenMPI).
</li><li> New subroutine <b>gptlprocess_namelist()</b> enables Fortran codes to
use a namelist to set <b>GPTL</b> options. This allows changing settings
without having to recompile or relink application
codes. See <a href="http://jmrosinski.github.com/GPTL/example5.html">Example 5</a> for example usage.
</li><li> New function <b>GPTLget_eventvalue()</b> allows an application to query
the current value of any PAPI-based event, including derived events.
</li><li> New function <b>GPTLget_wallclock()</b> allows an application to query
the current wallclock accumulation for any region.
</li><li> New function <b>GPTLbarrier()</b> calls <b>MPI_Barrier()</b> and times it.
</li><li> <em><b>parsegptlout.pl</b></em> now takes header name as an argument rather
than an integer index.
</li><li> <em><b>hex2name.pl</b></em> converts auto-instrumented entries for thread summary regions.
</li></ul>

<h3>gptl-v3.4.7</h3>
<ul>
<li> Derived events based on PAPI:
  <ul>
  <li> Computational intensity (GPTL_CI)
  </li><li> Instructions per cycle (GPTL_IPC)
  </li><li> FP ops per cycle (GPTL_FPC)
  </li><li> FP ops per instruction (GPTL_FPI)
  </li><li> Load-store instruction fraction (GPTL_LSTPI)
  </li><li> L1 miss rate (GPTL_DCMRT)
  </li><li> Load-stores per L1 miss (GPTL_LSTPDCM)
  </li></ul>
</li><li> New entry points <b>GPTLevent_code_to name()</b> and <b>GPTLevent_name_to_code()</b>
</li><li> Ability to disable portions of printed output (e.g. GPTLdopr_preamble)
</li><li> Better description of enabled events
</li></ul>
