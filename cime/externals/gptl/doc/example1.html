<h2>Example 1: Simple manual instrumentation</h2>
This is an OpenMP Fortran code manually instrumented with <b>GPTL</b> calls. The 
output produced by the embedded call to <b>gptlpr()</b> is shown and
explained. <b>PAPI</b> is used to compute floating point operation count.

<b><em>papiomptest.f90:</em></b>
<pre>
<div style="background-color:white;">
program papiomptest
  implicit none
  include 'gptl.inc'                 ! Fortran GPTL include file
  include 'f90papi.h'                ! Needed for PAPI_FP_OPS
  integer :: ret, iter
  integer, parameter :: nompiter = 2 ! Number of OMP threads

  ret = gptlsetoption (gptlabort_on_error, 1) ! Abort on GPTL error
  ret = gptlsetoption (PAPI_FP_OPS, 1)        ! Count floating point ops
  ret = gptlsetoption (gptlnarrowprint, 1)    ! Print fewer sig figs
  ret = gptlsetoption (gptlpercent, 1)        ! Turn on "% of" print
  ret = gptlsetoption (gptloverhead, 0)       ! Turn off overhead estimate
  ret = gptlinitialize ()                     ! Initialize GPTL
  ret = gptlstart ('total')                   ! Start a timer

!$OMP PARALLEL DO PRIVATE (iter)   ! Threaded loop
  do iter=1,nompiter
    ret = gptlstart ('A')          ! Start a timer

    ret = gptlstop ('CC')
    ret = gptlstop ('A')
    ret = gptlstop ('B')         
  end do
  ret = gptlstop ('total')
  ret = gptlpr (0)                 ! Print timer stats
  ret = gptlfinalize ()            ! Clean up
end program papiomptest
</div>
</pre>

Compile and link, then run:
<pre>
% gfortran -fopenmp papiomptest.f90 -I/usr/local/include -lgptl -lpapi 
% env OMP_NUM_THREADS=2 ./a.out
</pre>

The call to <b>gptlpr(0)</b> wrote a file named timing.0, which looks like this:

<pre>
<div style="background-color:white;">
PAPI event multiplexing was OFF
PAPI events enabled (including derived):
  Floating point operations executed

Underlying timing routine was gettimeofday.
Per-call utr overhead est: 2.9e-07 sec.
Per-call PAPI overhead est: 1.4e-07 sec.
If overhead stats are printed, roughly half the estimated number is
embedded in the wallclock (and/or PAPI counter) stats for each timer

If a '% of' field is present, it is w.r.t. the first timer for thread 0.
If a 'e6 per sec' field is present, it is in millions of PAPI counts per sec.

A '*' in column 1 below means the timer had multiple parents, though the
values printed are for all calls. Further down the listing is more detailed
information about multiple parents. Look for 'Multiple parent info'

<h3>Explanation of the above output</h3>
The output file contains a preamble which lists <b>PAPI</b>
settings such as whether multiplexing was on or off, and
which <b>PAPI</b> events were enabled. In this case 
"Floating point operations executed" were counted. Other preamble contents
include estimates of underlying timing routine (UTR)
overhead, <b>PAPI</b> overhead, and an explanation of the printed
statistics. 
<p>
The statistics themselves begin with the line which reads "Stats for
thread 0:". The region names are listed on the far left. A 
"region" is defined in the application by calling
<b>GPTLstart()</b>, then <b>GPTLstop()</b> for the same input (character
string) argument.
Indenting of 
the names preserves parent-child relationships between the regions. In
the example, we see that region "A" was contained in "total", "B"
contained in "A", and regions "C" and "CC" both contained in "B". 
<p>
Reading across the output from left to right, the next column is labelled
"Called". This is the number of times the region was invoked. If any regions
were called recursively, that information is printed next. In this case there
were no recursive calls, so just a "-" is printed. Total wallclock time for
each region is printed next, followed by the max and min values for any
single invocation. In this simple example each region was called only once, so
"Wallclock", "max", and "min" are all the same. The next column lists the
percentage of wallclock time each region took compared to the first
region timed, and was produced due to the call to <b>GPTLsetoption (GPTLpercent,1)</b>. 
Turning this option on is generally useful only if there is a single region
wrapping the entire execution ("total" in the above example).
<b>PAPI</b>-based statistics are presented next. In
the example, the counter PAPI_FP_OPS was enabled. The name was shortened to FP_OPS to
confine the printed output to as few columns as possible. Finally, each <b>PAPI</b>
count is divided by wallclock time and printed as millions per second (in
this case millions of floating point operations per second). This column can
be turned off, with a call to <b>GPTLsetoption (GPTLpersec, 0)</b>. 

<p>
Since this was a threaded code run with OMP_NUM_THREADS=2, statistics
for the second thread are also printed. It starts at "Stats for thread 1:" The
output shows that thread 1
participated in the computations for regions "A", "B", "C", and "CC", but not
"total". This is reflected in the code itself, since only the master
thread was active when start and stop calls were made for region "total".

<p>
After the per-thread statistics section, the same information is repeated, sorted by
region name if more than one thread was active. This section is delimited by
the string "Same stats sorted by
timer for threaded regions:". This region presentation order makes it easier
	to inspect for load 
balance across threads. The leftmost column is thread number, and the region
names are not indented. A sum across threads for each region is also printed,
and labeled "SUM".
