This file describes how to build and install GPTL. For information on using
the library, see the web pages in the doc/ directory, and the file README in
the main directory.

After untarring the distribution, construct a macros.make file by editing one
of the templates that is close to the machine you're building the library on
(e.g. macros.make.linux). Step-by-step instructions for setting each
configuration option are embedded in that file. If unsure of some settings,
you can run "./suggestions". This is an autoconf "configure" script which has
been modified to just print suggestions, rather than creating any output
files.

It is a good idea to build with FORTRAN=yes even if you're not going to use
the Fortran wrappers. Doing this means "make test" will do more thorough
testing of the library via the Fortran tests.

After creating macros.make:

% make
% make test
% make install

The "make test" step runs some of the example codes in ctests/ and ftests/
and checks the results.
