<h2>Example 7: Using GPTLstart_handle() and GPTLstop_handle()</h2>
This is a threaded Fortran code which uses functions <b>GPTLstart_handle()</b>
and <b>GPTLstop_handle()</b>. The purpose of these functions is to lower GPTL
overhead by maintaining in user-space the value of the hash function for the region of
interest, avoiding the overhead of hash table lookup every time the start or stop functions
are called. On initial invocation, a zero input value of the "handle"
argument is a flag which tells GPTL to compute the hash value and store its
contents for later use by the library.
<p>
The hash value for any given GPTL region is invariant across threads. So
per-thread copies of the handle are not needed. Also, these
functions can be freely mixed with their <b>GPTLstart()</b>
and <b>GPTLstop()</b> counterparts, as shown in the example below.

<p>
<b><em>handle.F90:</em></b>
<pre>
<div style="background-color:white;">
program handle
  use gptl
  implicit none

  integer :: handle1       ! Hash index
  integer :: n
  integer :: ret

  ret = gptlinitialize ()

  ret = gptlstart ('total') ! Time the entire code
! IMPORTANT: Start with a zero handle value so GPTLstart_handle knows to initialize
! Instead of setting handle1=0 here we could also do:
! ret=gptlinit_handle('loop', handle1)
! This latter approach is actually preferable to avoid one-time multiple threads
! computing the handle value inside the threaded loop.
  handle1 = 0

!$OMP PARALLEL DO SHARED (handle1)
  do n=1,1000000
! First call the "_handle" versions of start and stop for the region
    ret = gptlstart_handle ('loop', handle1)
    ret = gptlstop_handle ('loop', handle1)
! Now call the standard start and stop functions for the same region
    ret = gptlstart ('loop')
    ret = gptlstop ('loop')
  end do
  ret = gptlstop ('total') ! Time the entire code

  ret = gptlpr (0)
  stop
end program handle
</div>
</pre>
Now compile and run:
<pre>
<div>
% mpif90 -fopenmp -o handle handle.F90 -L.. -lgptl
% ./handle
</div>
</pre>

Here's the important output from the timing.0 file that got created by the
call to gptlpr(0):

Total overhead of 1 GPTL start or GPTLstop call=1.08e-07 seconds

<h3>Explanation of the above output</h3>
Only a single region named "loop" was timed. It was called a total of 2
million times across 4 threads. One million for the loop induction variable,
and another factor of two for the two different flavors of <b>GPTLstart()</b>
and <b>GPTLstop()</b>. These different flavors each accumulated time into
the same reported timer ("loop"). 
<p>
It is worth noting that the reported
overhead assumes that only <b>GPTLstart()</b> and <b>GPTLstop()</b> were
called. This estimate can be further refined in this example by taking the reported 28.7%
of overhead that is due to generating the hash index, multiplying it by 0.5 (since
half of the start/stop calls used the "_handle" GPTL routines which don't
need to generate hash indices), and subtracting that fraction from the 0.108
seconds reported overhead to a new overhead estimate of 0.092 seconds.
<p>
Note that the reported overhead was very high relative to the cost of the
work being timed. This is understandable considering that no real work is
being done between GPTL "start" and "stop" calls.
