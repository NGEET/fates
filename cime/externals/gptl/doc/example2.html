<h2>Example 2: Auto-instrumentation</h2>
This example is a C code compiled with auto-instrumentation enabled. It
uses <b>PAPI</b> to count total instructions, and instructions per cycle. Note
that function <em>B</em> has multiple parents, and <b>GPTL</b> reports the
	multiple parent information in the output produced by the call
	to <b>GPTLpr_file()</b>. 
<p>
<b><em>main.c:</em></b>
<pre>
<div style="background-color:white;">
#include &#60gptl.h&gt
#include &#60papi.h&gt

int main ()
{
  void do_work (void);
  int i, ret;
  ret = GPTLsetoption (GPTL_IPC, 1);     // Count instructions per cycle
  ret = GPTLsetoption (PAPI_TOT_INS, 1); // Print total instructions
  ret = GPTLsetoption (GPTLoverhead, 0); // Don't print overhead estimate
  ret = GPTLinitialize ();               // Initialize GPTL
  ret = GPTLstart ("main");              // Start a manual timer
  do_work ();                            // Do some work 
  ret = GPTLstop ("main");               // Stop the manual timer
  ret = GPTLpr_file ("outfile");         // Write output to "outfile"
}
</div>
</pre>

<b><em>subs.c:</em></b>
<div style="background-color:white;">
<pre>
#include &#60unistd.h&gt

extern void A(void);
extern void AA(void);
extern void B(void);

void do_work ()
{
  A ();
  AA ();
  B ();
}

void A ()
{
  B ();
}

void AA ()
{
}

void B ()
{
  sleep (1);
}
</div>
</pre>
Compile all but <em>main.c</em> with auto-instrumentation, then link and
run. Useful auto-instrumentation of the main program is not possible,
because the call to <b>GPTLinitialize()</b> must be done manually and
needs to preceed all calls to <b>GPTLstart</b> and <b>GPTLstop</b>. 
<pre>
% gcc -c main.c
% gcc -finstrument-functions subs.c main.o -lgptl -lpapi
% ./a.out
</pre>

Now convert the auto-instrumented output to human-readable form:
<pre>
% hex2name.pl a.out outfile > outfile.converted
</pre>

Output file <em> outfile.converted</em> looks like this:
<pre>
<div style="background-color:white;">
PAPI event multiplexing was OFF
Description of printed events (PAPI and derived):
  GPTL_IPC: Instructions per cycle
  Instr completed  

PAPI events enabled (including those required for derived events):
  PAPI_TOT_INS
  PAPI_TOT_CYC

Underlying timing routine was gettimeofday.
Per-call utr overhead est: 1.65e-06 sec.
Per-call PAPI overhead est: 3.4e-07 sec.
If overhead stats are printed, roughly half the estimated number is
embedded in the wallclock stats for each timer.
Print method was most_frequent.
If a '%_of' field is present, it is w.r.t. the first timer for thread 0.
If a 'e6_per_sec' field is present, it is in millions of PAPI counts per sec.

A '*' in column 1 below means the timer had multiple parents, though the
values printed are for all calls. Further down the listing is more detailed
information about multiple parents. Look for 'Multiple parent info'

Stats for thread 0:
                       Called  Recurse Wallclock max       min       IPC      TOT_INS  e6_/_sec 
  main                       1     -       2.000     2.000     2.000 2.81e-01    18060     0.01 
    do_work                  1     -       2.000     2.000     2.000 2.61e-01    12547     0.01 
      A                      1     -       1.000     1.000     1.000 3.01e-01     4958     0.00 
*       B                    2     -       2.000     1.000     1.000 1.09e-01     2812     0.00 
      AA                     1     -       0.000     0.000     0.000 7.77e-01      488   244.00 
Total calls           = 6
Total recursive calls = 0

Multiple parent info (if any) for thread 0:
Columns are count and name for the listed child
Rows are each parent, with their common child being the last entry, which is indented
Count next to each parent is the number of times it called the child
Count next to child is total number of times it was called by the listed parents

       1 A                         
       1 do_work                         
       2   B                         
</div>
</pre>
<h3>Explanation of the above output</h3>
<b>PAPI</b> event "Total instructions executed"
(PAPI_TOT_INS) and derived event "Instructions per
cycle" (GPTL_IPC) were enabled. To compute instructions per
cycle, <b>GPTL</b> made the 
<b>PAPI</b> library call to count total cycles (PAPI_TOT_CYC) in addition to
the already-enabled event PAPI_TOT_INS. When
<b>GPTLpr_file()</b> was called, it computed:
<pre>
      GPTL_IPC = PAPI_TOT_INS / PAPI_TOT_CYC;
</pre>
<p>
Note the asterisk in front of region "B". This
indicates that region "B" had multiple parents. It is presented as a child of
region "A" because that is the first region that invoked it. Information
about other parents is presented after the main call tree. It shows that
region "B" had two parents, "A", and "do_work". Each parent invoked "B" once,
for a total of 2 calls.
